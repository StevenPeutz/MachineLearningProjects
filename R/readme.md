For structural equation modelling (SEM) I prefer using R over Python, because of the Lavaan package.  
These file contain certain SEM models of UX (as CSat scores):
- a simple one
- a 2nd order SEM a
- and a MIMIC (Multiple Indicator Multiple Causes) model.  
This is using real data collected by a large commercial airline.  

Four underlying factors (dimensions) of customer satisfaction are modeled here in three different ways, and evaluated on overall fit as well as relative model comparisons.
